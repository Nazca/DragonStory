//this is the main file called when the user is viewing, giving input, or otherwise monitering the gamestate.

//it's possible that we've ended up here without sending any log in information.

//we should check to see if a user is logged in real quick  If they are and we have no input, display the game state on the home page
//if we have log in information lets give that to the InputController so that we may clean it, modify the game state, and display it to the users

//if they are not logged in and we have no input lets redirect to index.php
