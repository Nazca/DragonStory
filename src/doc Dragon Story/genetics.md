### genetics

First generation dragons are all red, blue, or yellow.  These are the eggs given to players for free upon log in.

Their genes are RR YY and BB.

R, Y, B are tied as the three most dominant genes.

If the genes are the same, that color dragon will be born

If they are not the same the child will be the color of the most dominant dragon.

In the case that the genes are tied in dominance they create a combination color of dragon as a child.  Y and B will make the new gene GG which will be recessive to all Y, R, and B

Parents YY and BB would make child GG

If GG then made a child with RR the table would be the following

    G   G
R   Rg  Rg

R   Rg  Rg

A red Dragon with genes Rg would be the result.

An image reference can be found at dragonstory.hamfingered.com/images/color-wheel.png  This makes this 3rd generation of colors the most rare, most recessive, and most valuable.

This system should be followed for all features of the dragons.

A red and yellow dragon RR and YY may produce to make an OO dragon.

    Y   Y
R   OO  OO

R   OO  OO

And orange and a green dragon (both 2nd generation) may produce the following children

    G   G
O   YY  YY

O   YY  YY

an orange male dragon and yellow female dragon (Yellow is dominant to orange) will result in a yellow dragon with a 10% chance for that dragon to mutate to be Yellow-Orange  A yellow male and a orange female will always produce a dominant yellow child.

If the male is the recessive gene, there is a chance to mutate to the combination color.

If the female is the recessive gene, the dominant gene wins.

Every dragon hatched has a .01% to become a black dragon unless a black dragon exists in which the chance is none.  Black genes are hard dominant to all genes. black black is black, but black recessive is grey.

If a black dragon does exist the chance is now to get a white dragon which is hard recessive to all other genes. white white is white, but white anything is that other color.  Except in the unusual case of black, in which the dragon would be grey.

This design concept should follow all features of the dragons.
The more recessive the gene the more beautiful and exotic the trait.
