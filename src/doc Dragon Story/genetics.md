### genetics

First generation dragons are all red, blue, or yellow.  These are the eggs given to players for free upon log in.

Their genes are RR YY and BB.

R, Y, B are tied as the three most dominant genes.

If the genes are the same, that color dragon will be born

If they are not the same the child will be the color of the most dominant dragon.

In the case that the genes are tied in dominance they create a combination color of dragon as a child.  Y and B will make the new gene GG which will be recessive to all Y, R, and B

Parents YY and BB would make child GG

If GG then made a child with RR the table would be the following

    G   G
R   Rg  Rg

R   Rg  Rg

A red Dragon with genes Rg would be the result.

A dragon born Rg with a dominant and a recessive has a 10% chance to mutate into BV BV  a blue violate dragon.

An image reference can be found at dragonstory.hamfingered.com/images/color-wheel.png  This makes this 3rd generation of colors the most rare, most recessive, and most valuable.

This system should be followed for all features of the dragons.
